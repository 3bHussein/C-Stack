# Stack
This is a linked-list implementation of a Stack. Basically, a stack is a linear data structure in which the insertion and deletion operations are performed at the same position, the **top**. for more about of the stack abstract data type, click [here](http://btechsmartclass.com/DS/U2_T1.html).

## Sorting
 - LIFO (Last in, First out) so the one who comes later, leaves earlier, just like a stack of plates to wash: You always begin at the top

## Operations
 - push (add to the top)
 - pop (remove from the top)
 - top
 - is_empty
 - clear

## How to Run?

```
gcc -o stack stack.c
chmod +r stack
./stack
```
